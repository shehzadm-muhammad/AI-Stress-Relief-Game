# AI-Driven Stress Relief Game (Final-Year Project)

This repository contains the design and planning for my **Final-Year Honours
Project** in BSc Computer Science.

The project focuses on developing an **AI-driven interactive game** aimed at
supporting **stress relief and wellbeing** through personalised and adaptive
gameplay experiences.

> 🚧 **Project Status:** In progress (research and design phase)

---

## 🎯 Project Motivation

Stress and mental fatigue are common among university students, and many existing
stress-relief applications provide static or generic experiences. This project
explores how **AI-driven adaptation** can be used to create a more engaging and
personalised stress-relief experience through an interactive game.

---

## 🧠 Project Aim

To design and develop an interactive game that uses AI techniques to adapt content
and interactions based on user behaviour and basic emotional indicators, with the
goal of supporting stress relief and user wellbeing.

---

## 🔍 Planned AI Concepts

The project will explore lightweight AI techniques suitable for a non-clinical,
entertainment-focused application, such as:

- User behaviour analysis
- Basic sentiment or mood detection
- Rule-based or heuristic adaptation
- Adaptive difficulty or content flow

The focus is on **responsible and ethical use of AI**, rather than complex or
clinical AI systems.

## 🛠️ Planned Technologies

- Programming Language: **C#**
- Development Environment: **Visual Studio**
- Game Framework: *(to be finalised during development)*
- Version Control: **Git & GitHub**

---

## ⚖️ Ethical & Design Considerations

- The project is **non-clinical** and does not provide medical or mental health
  advice
- User wellbeing, accessibility, and inclusivity are prioritised
- Data usage will be minimal and privacy-aware
- The game will avoid manipulative or harmful design patterns

---

## 📈 Current Status

The project is currently in the **research and design phase**, focusing on:
- Literature review
- Ethical considerations
- AI feasibility analysis
- Game concept and mechanics design

Implementation and testing will be carried out in later development stages.
